# Automated Plant Watering System 🌱

This smart home automation project automatically waters plants based on real-time soil moisture readings. It uses an Arduino microcontroller and Java-based logic to detect dryness and trigger a water pump until the plant reaches optimal moisture.

## 📌 Features
- Monitors soil moisture using a sensor
- Automatically waters the plant until ideal moisture is reached
- OLED screen displays real-time status updates
- Java program allows user interaction (e.g. input number of watering days)
- System checks 24 times a day
